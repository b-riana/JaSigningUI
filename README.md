# JaSigningUI
Designing a user-friendly interface that allows users to select an English phrase and outputs an  ASL signing avatar animation generated by JASigning.

Animations were generated using the JASigning video generator: https://vh.cmp.uea.ac.uk/index.php/JASigning_Video_Generator

The UI will be designed using HTML, CSS, and Java.

The goal of this project is to create an application than can be easily navigated by a retail employee to more easily communicate with a deaf customer.
